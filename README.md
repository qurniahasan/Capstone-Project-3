# Capstone-Project-3

#### **Background Context**

With rapid urban growth, the need for efficient, environmentally friendly, and affordable transportation alternatives is increasing. In this context, bike rental systems, also known as bike sharing, have become a popular solution in many cities worldwide.

**Importance of Bike Sharing**
<br>
* **Urban Mobility** : Bike sharing provides easy and flexible transportation access for city residents, tourists, and workers.<br>
* **Health and Environment** : Using bicycles as a means of transportation reduces air pollution and carbon emissions, and promotes an active and healthy lifestyle.<br>
* **Traffic Congestion** : Bike sharing can help alleviate traffic congestion by providing a faster and more efficient transportation alternative, especially for short trips within the city.

#### **Problem Statement**

Bike sharing systems have emerged as a popular solution for urban transportation needs, offering a convenient, environmentally friendly, and cost-effective mode of travel. However, managing bike sharing operations efficiently requires a deep understanding of usage patterns, factors influencing demand, and operational challenges.

The aim of this project is to perform predictive analysis on bike sharing data to optimize the operation of the bike sharing system. By leveraging machine learning techniques, we seek to predict the demand for bicycles based on various factors such as weather conditions, time of day, day of the week, and special events.

The goal is accurate predictive models that can forecast bike demand with high precision, insights into key factors influencing bike usage patterns, facilitating informed decision-making in system optimization and infrastructure planning.
